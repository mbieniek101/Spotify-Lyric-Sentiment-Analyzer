# Hackathon

This is a forked copy of the UB Hackathon project I worked on in 2023. We had fun learning and experimenting with our knowledge of web design and working with APIs and the associated challenges with applying these skills in a way we never have before.

Idea
==
With the ability of music to convey emotion, a person's music history can directly correlate to their mood. Wouldn't you want to know what kind of mood you've had throughout the day?

Implementation
==
Using Spotify's and AZLyrics open API we will find out a user's previous ten songs. We will analyze the song lyrics to determine the overall emotion of every song. Then plot the data in a nice easy-to-read format. This will all be done through a convenient website. We used VaderSentiment as a prebuilt model for sentiment and emotion analysis.
